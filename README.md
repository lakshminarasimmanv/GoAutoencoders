## Autoencoders using Go

Autoencoders are neural networks which are used to learn efficient representations of the input data (encoding) and can be used for dimensionality reduction and/or classification. In this Go implementation, we will use autoencoders for dimensionality reduction.

The input data is first mapped to a hidden layer with fewer neurons than the input layer. The hidden layer is then mapped back to the input layer. The weights of the hidden layer are then updated so that the input data is reconstructed as accurately as possible.

This process is repeated for a number of iterations. The hidden layer weights will eventually converge to a representation of the input data which is efficient in the sense that it contains the most important information about the input data while discarding less important information.

Autoencoders can be used for dimensionality reduction by simply discarding the weights of the input layer. The hidden layer will then contain a lower-dimensional representation of the input data.

## Example

We will use a simple example to illustrate how autoencoders work. We will use the following input data:

```
[
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
]
```

This input data is a one-hot encoded representation of the numbers 0-5. We will use a two-dimensional hidden layer. The weights of the hidden layer will be initialized to random values. The input data is then mapped to the hidden layer and back to the input layer. The hidden layer weights are then updated so that the input data is reconstructed as accurately as possible. This process is repeated for a number of iterations.

The hidden layer weights will eventually converge to the following values:

```
[
 [1, 0],
 [0, 1],
 [0, 1],
 [1, 0],
 [0, 1],
 [1, 0]
]
```

This hidden layer representation is a lower-dimensional representation of the input data. The autoencoder has effectively learned to encode the input data in a more efficient way.

## Usage

To use the autoencoder, first create a new instance of the `NeuralNetwork` type:

```go
var nn NeuralNetwork
```

Then, initialize the neural network with the `Init` function:

```go
nn.Init()
```

Next, create a set of inputs and targets. The inputs should be a two-dimensional slice of floats, where each element is a slice of floats representing an input vector. The targets should be a two-dimensional slice of floats, where each element is a slice of floats representing a target vector. For example, the following inputs and targets could be used for a two-dimensional autoencoder:

```go
inputs := [][inputNeurons]float64{
	{0.0, 0.0},
	{0.0, 1.0},
	{1.0, 0.0},
	{1.0, 1.0},
}
targets := [][outputNeurons]float64{
	{0.0, 0.0},
	{1.0, 1.0},
	{1.0, 1.0},
	{0.0, 0.0},
}
```

Then, train the autoencoder with the `Train` function:

```go
nn.Train(inputs, targets)
```

Finally, test the autoencoder with the `Test` function:

```go
nn.Test(inputs, targets)
```

## Parameters

There are a number of parameters that can be adjusted to change the behavior of the autoencoder. These parameters can be adjusted by changing the corresponding constants at the top of the code:

- `inputNeurons`: the number of neurons in the input layer
- `hiddenNeurons`: the number of neurons in the hidden layer
- `outputNeurons`: the number of neurons in the output layer
- `iterations`: the number of training iterations
- `learningRate`: the learning rate
- `momentum`: the momentum
